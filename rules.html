        <p><strong>Updated August 10, 2023</strong></p>

        <p><strong>ARTICLE I – Name</strong></p>
        <p>This game shall be referred to as “Century Pong”. In some circumstances, CP or ceeps may be a valid substitute.</p>

        <p><strong>ARTICLE II– Setup</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>55 solo cups are set up on each side in a triangle formation with 10 cups in the back row</li>
            <li>A 30 rack is poured evenly into each side’s cups except for the bitch cup</li>
            <li>Bitch cup should be poured to the highest line in the middle cup (fourth cup in the seventh row)</li>
            <li>Eye to Eye is used to determine who goes first, players on each team rotate taking one shot until one makes and the other misses. The ball is shot on the second “Eye”</li>
            <li>Each team consists of 4 brothers of the fraternity</li>
            <li>Gents are not default, but can be agreed upon before the game starts</li>
            <li>All players must pay their share before the game starts</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>ARTICLE III– Playing Century Pong</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Section I - Rounds</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your cup must be empty before you throw your shot</li>
                    <li>Finish your drink or forfeit your shot</li>
                    <li>Each round consists of all four players shooting their ball at the opposite team’s cups</li>
                    <li>If all four players make their shots on the same turn, then the team gets another four shots</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Section II – Re-racks</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A re-rack may be called 3 times during the game</li>
                    <li>First is when there are 21 cups left on the table. 6 cups in the back</li>
                    <li>Second is when there are 10 cups left. 4 cups in the back</li>
                    <li>The last one may be called for any regular cup pong re-rack</li>
                    <li>Gents doesn’t count as a re-rack</li>
                    <li>Re-racks must be called at the beginning of a team’s turn</li>
                    <li>If too many cups are hit (e.g., there are 20 cups left) then the front cup is excluded</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Section III – Defense</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>One player from each team plays defense while the opposing team shoots</li>
                    <li>Ball must hit either the table/wall/ceiling or a cup before defense can hit it</li>
                    <li>If defense hits the ball out of the air before, then a cup is removed, and the point is given to the shooter</li>
                    <li>If a ball is swirling in a cup, then it is counted and defense cannot finger or blow</li>
                    <li>If defense knocks over a cup while the thrower shoots, then the cup is removed, and a point is given to the thrower</li>
                    <li>If more than one is knocked over, then one point is given to the thrower and the rest are marked as an “error” on the scorecard</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Section IV – End of game</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a team hits their final cup, the rest of the team continues to shoot. For each extra time it is hit, the offense can decline a person to shoot redemption from the other team</li>
                    <li>The opposing team gets redemption where each player shoots until they miss a cup</li>
                    <li>OT can be forced by hitting all the remaining cups</li>
                    <li>Overtime is set up as a 2x1 triangle with a fourth cup placed on top</li>
                    <li>The top cup must be hit first to count, and if it falls over then it also counts</li>
                    <li>Normal rules until a team wins</li>
                    <li>Cups hit during OT are denoted with an * and then a tally</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Section V – Post-game</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The scorecard goes to the player that hit the most cups on the winning side</li>
                    <li>If there is a tie, then it goes to the person who reached that number first, unless the other person hit the last cup to tie it</li>
                    <li>If a player on the losing team hits 9 or less cups, they must run a naked lap</li>
                    <li>If one team re racks twice before their opponents re rack once, then whichever team loses runs a naked lap</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
